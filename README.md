text based rpg pet game

I am a beginner at Java programming language and
I'm going to show the steps I go making my first game. 
I'm very sorry for the video quality.
Next video I will invest in a better program. 
I really hope to get advice and feedback/as well as friends to help.

So what i'm doing is making a open source community JavaScript text based game.
Even if you have never coded and want to get into it I always need testers
thank you again
